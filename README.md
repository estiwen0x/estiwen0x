## 💻 Systems, Server & Network Specialist

Low-level Windows systems research, server architecture, and network engineering.

I focus on **understanding the system, not just using it**.  
I design scalable, secure, and high-performance solutions from OS internals to distributed networks.

---

## 🔹 Core Expertise

- **Windows Internals:** Manual PE loading, memory manipulation, process injection, IAT & TLS handling  
- **Server Engineering:** High-performance, fault-tolerant server architectures  
- **Networking:** Custom protocols, routing, and network security analysis  
- **Security Research:** User-mode loader analysis, reverse engineering, EDR bypass concepts  
- **Programming:** C, C++, Python (automation & tooling), Bash, PowerShell

---

## 🔹 Key Projects (Research-Focused)

- **System Loader Research** — Manual mapping & runtime module handling (inspired by SwiftLoader, fully internal PoC)  
- **Memory Visualizer** — Low-level memory & PE structure analyzer  
- **Network Toolkit** — Server-client benchmarking and packet analysis framework  

> Projects are research-oriented. Purpose: **demonstrate deep understanding, not just shipping code**.

---

## 🔹 Philosophy

> Minimal surface. Maximum depth. Control everything, abstract nothing.  

I aim to **understand the system completely before touching frameworks or libraries**.
