## Systems, Server & Network Specialist
**Low-level Windows systems research and network engineering.**

I focus on **understanding the system, not just using it.** My work involves designing secure, high-performance solutions by interfacing directly with OS internals and bypassing high-level abstractions.

---

### Core Expertise & Research Areas

* **Windows Internals:** Manual PE mapping, runtime image hijacking, IAT/TLS reconstruction, and direct syscall invocation.
* **Low-Level Development:** Performance-critical C/C++ engineering with a focus on zero-dependency implementations.
* **Reverse Engineering:** Analyzing user-mode loaders, EDR hooks, and binary obfuscation techniques.
* **Network Infrastructure:** Custom protocol design, kernel-mode packet filtering, and high-availability server architectures.

### Featured Projects

* **[NT-Internal-Scanner](https://github.com/estiwen0x/NT-Internal-Scanner)**
  *Header-only C++ library for disk-based SSN recovery and stealthy memory pattern scanning.*
* **[SwiftLoader](https://github.com/estiwen0x/swiftloader-research)**
  *Research-focused manual PE mapper with robust import resolution and TLS handling.*

### Philosophy
> *Minimal surface. Maximum depth. Control everything, abstract nothing.*

I aim to understand the underlying mechanics completely before engaging with any framework.
